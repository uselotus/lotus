title: "Cancel a subscription"
description: "Cancels a subscription. You can modify the behavior of the cancellation based on
the arguments passed to the call."
openapi: "DELETE /api/subscriptions/plans/"
---

A Cancel Subscription call requires either a `customer_id` or a `plan_id`. You can provide one, the other, or both. If you don't provide one of the parameters, the call will cancel all subscriptions matching the other parameter.

Optionally you can provide the following parameters:

- `subscription_filters` a list of dictionaries containing property_name and value keys for filtering subscriptions to cancel.
- `flat_fee_behavior` choices are ["refund", "prorate", "charge_full"]
- `bill_usage` a boolean indicating whether to bill for usage up to the end of the subscription
- `invoicing_behavior` choices are ["add_to_next_invoice", "invoice_now"]

```py Python
lotus.cancel_subscription(
    customer_id='cust_0569173e-e665-4369',
    subscription_filters=[
        {
            "property_name": "status",
            "value": "active",
        },
    ],
    flat_fee_behavior='prorate',
    bill_usage=True,
    invoicing_behavior='add_to_next_invoice',
)

lotus.cancel_subscription(
    plan_id='plan_A',
    subscription_filters=[
        {
            "property_name": "created_date",
            "value": "2020-08-15",
        },
    ],
    flat_fee_behavior='charge_full',
    bill_usage=False,
    invoicing_behavior='invoice_now',
)
```

```ts Typescript

await lotus.cancelSubscription({
  planId: "plan234234"
